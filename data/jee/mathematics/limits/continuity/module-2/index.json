    {
      "question": "What type of discontinuity does f(x) = (x²-1)/(x-1) have at x = 1?",
      "options": ["Removable", "Jump", "Infinite", "None"],
      "answer": 0,
      "explanation": "The function can be simplified to f(x) = x + 1 for x ≠ 1, so it has a removable discontinuity."

    {
      "question": "According to the Intermediate Value Theorem, if f(1) = 2 and f(3) = 8, what can we conclude?",
      "options": [
        "f(2) = 5",
        "There exists c in (1,3) such that f(c) = 5",
        "f is continuous on [1,3]",
        "None of the above"

      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "The IVT guarantees that for any value between f(1) and f(3), there exists a point c where f(c) equals that value."
