It's the value that the function approaches, not necessarily the value it reaches.</p><h2>Key Concepts</h2><ul><li><strong>Left-hand limit:</strong> The limit as x approaches from the left</li><li><strong>Right-hand limit:</strong> The limit as x approaches from the right</li><li><strong>Two-sided limit:</strong> Both left and right limits exist and are equal</li></ul><h2>Continuity</h2><p>A function is continuous at a point if:</p><ol><li>The function is defined at that point</li><li>The limit exists at that point</li><li>The limit equals the function value</li></ol>",

      "question": "What is the limit of (x² - 4)/(x - 2) as x → 2?",
      "options": ["0", "2", "4", "Does not exist"],
      "answer": 2,
      "explanation": "Simplify: (x² - 4) = (x - 2)(x + 2); cancel (x - 2); at x = 2 → 4."

      "question": "Which of the following is true about continuity?",
      "options": [
        "A function is continuous if it has no breaks",
        "A function is continuous if its limit exists",
        "A function is continuous if f(a) = lim(x→a) f(x)",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "answer": 3,
      "explanation": "Continuity requires the function to be defined, the limit to exist, and the limit to equal the function value."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the left-hand limit of f(x) = |x|/x as x → 0?",
      "options": ["1", "-1", "0", "Does not exist"],
      "answer": 1,
      "explanation": "For x < 0, |x| = -x, so |x|/x = -x/x = -1."
